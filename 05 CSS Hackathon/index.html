        <p>
          The Prodigy were founded in Braintree, Essex, in 1990 by keyboardist and
          songwriter Liam Howlett. He had taken piano lessons in his youth and gained the
          ability to play difficult passages in just a few run-throughs. After he decided
          to pursue a music career, Howlett met dancer and vocalist Keith Flint in
          mid-1989 at a rave at which Howlett was DJing. After Flint requested Howlett to
          make a mix tape for him, Howlett obliged, returning a cassette several days
          later with a collection of his own songs on the other side. Howlett had
          scratched the word "Prodigy" onto the cassette, the same name as the Moog
          Prodigy analogue synthesiser, and Howlett's moniker.The tape was well received
          by Flint and keyboardist Leeroy Thornhill who developed new dance sequences to
          the music and suggested to Howlett they begin a group together. They were soon
          joined by MC and vocalist Maxim, then known as Maxim Reality, and female dancer
          and vocalist Sharky, a friend of Flint's. Together they became the first line-up
          of the Prodigy.

          The Moog Prodigy was a monophonic analogue synthesizer produced by Moog Music
          from 1979 to 1984. Of the 11,000 produced, versions released after 1981 included
          a control voltage/gate input on the back that allowed the VCF to be triggered
          and controlled by an external source. The Prodigy was capable of a full range of
          synthetic sounds, from a gentle whistle or flute in the upper ranges, to
          sub-sonic bass. The voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) was controllable only via
          a second 3-stage ADR envelope controller. The low frequency oscillator (LFO) of
          the Prodigy featured a triangle and square waveform, which could be routed to
          the VCO or VCF to create pitch or filter modulation effects. The Moog Source,
          which began production in 1981, featured internal workings very similar to the
          Prodigy in a much sleeker physical design that featured programmability,
          arpeggiator / sequencer and white noise. It inspired the name of British
          electronic band The Prodigy whilst recording their first album. The band's
          frontman, Liam Howlett, is known to have used the synthesizer in some of the
          songs he made in the early 1990s.
